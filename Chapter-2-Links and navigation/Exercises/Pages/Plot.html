        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p>Minecraft doesn't have a traditional plot. Players are free to create their own world and story. The primary objective in the game is to survive, explore, and build. The game also features "The End," where players must defeat the Ender Dragon, marking a type of game completion.</p>
